## A Disciplined Approach to DSA

Inspired by the discipline of Miyamoto Musashi, I am starting this journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms.

### The Plan

-   **Daily Practice:** I will solve a minimum of 4 DSA questions every day.
    -   2 questions will be from previously studied topics (review).
    -   2 questions will be on new topics.
    -   I'll aim to do more if time allows.
-   **Learning Source:** I will be learning from Striver's DSA series on YouTube.
-   **Focus:** The current priority is to learn DSA fundamentals thoroughly, rather than focusing on LeetCode.
-   **Future Goal:** I plan to start practicing on LeetCode in about 3 months, once my foundation is solid.

> I hope I'll be able to stick to it. Let's give it my best!
